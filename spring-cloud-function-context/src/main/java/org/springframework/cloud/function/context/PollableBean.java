/**
 *
 * A marker and qualifier annotation to signal that
 * annotated functional factory method is a bean (e.g., Supplier, Function or Consumer)
 * that also needs to be polled periodically.
 * <br>
 * This has special significance to the reactive suppliers (e.g., {@code Supplier<Flux<?>>}),
 * since by default they are treated as producers of an infinite stream.
 * However if such suppliers produce a finite stream they may need to be triggered again.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * NOTE: The spring-cloud-function framework provides no default post processing behavior for this annotation. This
 * means that annotating a factory method with this annotation will not have any effect without some application/framework
 * specific post processing (see spring-cloud-stream as an example).
