Build from the command line (and "install" the samples):

----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

(If you like to YOLO add `-DskipTests`.)

Run one of the samples, e.g.

----
$ java -jar spring-cloud-function-samples/function-sample/target/*.jar
----

This runs the app and exposes its functions over HTTP, so you can
convert a string to uppercase, like this:

----
$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/uppercase -d Hello
HELLO
----

You can convert multiple strings (a `Flux<String>`) by separating them
with new lines

----
$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/uppercase -d 'Hello
> World'
HELLOWORLD
----

(You can use `^Q^J` in a terminal to insert a new line in a literal
string like that.)

== Building and Running a Function

The sample `@SpringBootApplication` above has a function that can be
decorated at runtime by Spring Cloud Function to be an HTTP endpoint,
or a Stream processor, for instance with RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka or
JMS.

The `@Beans` can be `Function`, `Consumer` or `Supplier` (all from
`java.util`), and their parametric types can be String or POJO. A
`Function` is exposed as a Spring Cloud Stream `Processor` if
`spring-cloud-function-stream` is on the classpath.
A `Consumer` is also exposed as a Stream
`Sink` and a `Supplier` translates to a Stream `Source`. 
HTTP endpoints are exposed if the Stream binder is `spring-cloud-stream-binder-servlet`.

Functions can be of `Flux<String>` or `Flux<Pojo>` and Spring Cloud
Function takes care of converting the data to and from the desired
types, as long as it comes in as plain text or (in the case of the
POJO) JSON. TBD: support for `Flux<Message<Pojo>>` and maybe plain
`Pojo` types (Fluxes implied and implemented by the framework).

Functions can be grouped together in a single application, or deployed
one-per-jar. It's up to the developer to choose. An app with multiple
functions can be deployed multiple times in different "personalities",
exposing different functions over different physical transports.
