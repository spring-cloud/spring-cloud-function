The https://azure.microsoft.com[Azure] adapter bootstraps a Spring Cloud Function context and channels function calls from the Azure framework into the user functions, using Spring Boot configuration where necessary. Azure Functions has quite a unique, but invasive programming model, involving annotations in user code that are specific to the platform. The easiest way to use it with Spring Cloud is to extend a base class and write a method in it with the `@FunctionName` annotation which delegates to a base class method.
