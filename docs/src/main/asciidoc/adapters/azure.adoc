The https://azure.microsoft.com[Azure] adapter bootstraps a Spring Cloud Function context and channels function calls from the Azure framework into the user functions, using Spring Boot configuration where necessary. Azure Functions has quite a unique, but invasive programming model, involving annotations in user code that are specific to the platform. The Spring Cloud Function Azure adapter trades the convenience of these annotations for portability of the function implementations. Instead of using the annotations you have to write some JSON by hand (at least for now) to guide the platform to call the right methods in the adapter.
