The adapter has a generic http request handler that you can use.
There is a `AzureSpringBootRequestHandler` which you must extend, and provide the input and output types as type parameters (enabling Azure to inspect the class and do the JSON conversions itself).

If your app has more than one `@Bean` of type `Function` etc. then you can choose the one to use by configuring `function.name`.
The functions are extracted from the Spring Cloud `FunctionCatalog`.

=== Notes on JAR Layout

You don't need the Spring Cloud Function Web at runtime in Azure, so you need to exclude this before you create the JAR you deploy to Azure.
A function application on Azure has to be shaded, but a Spring Boot standalone application does not, so you can run the same app using 2 separate jars (as per the sample here).
The sample app creates the shaded jar file, with an `azure` classifier for deploying in Azure.

=== JSON Configuration

The Azure tooling needs to find some JSON configuration files to tell it how to deploy and integrate the function (e.g. which Java class to use as the entry point, and which triggers to use). Those files can be created with the Maven plugin for a non-Spring function, but the tooling doesn't work yet with the adapter in its current form. There is an example `function.json` in the sample which hooks the function up as an HTTP endpoint:

```
{
  "scriptFile" : "../function-sample-azure-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-azure.jar",
  "entryPoint" : "example.FooHandler.execute",
  "bindings" : [ {
    "type" : "httpTrigger",
    "name" : "foo",
    "direction" : "in",
    "authLevel" : "anonymous",
    "methods" : [ "get", "post" ]
  }, {
    "type" : "http",
    "name" : "$return",
    "direction" : "out"
  } ],
  "disabled" : false
}
```


== Build

----
./mvnw -U clean package
----

== Running the sample

You can run the sample locally, just like the other Spring Cloud Function samples:

---
./mvnw spring-boot:run
---

and `curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/function -d '{"value": "hello foobar"}'`.

You will need the `az` CLI app and some node.js fu (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-java-maven for more detail). To deploy the function on Azure runtime:

----
$ az login
$ mvn azure-functions:deploy
----

On another terminal try this: `curl https://<azure-function-url-from-the-log>/api/uppercase -d '{"value": "hello foobar!"}'`. Please ensure that you use the right URL for the function above. Alternatively you can test the function in the Azure Dashboard UI (click on the function name, go to the right hand side and click "Test" and to the bottom right, "Run").

The input type for the function in the Azure sample is a Foo with a single property called "value". So you need this to test it with something like below:

----
{
  "value": "foobar"
}
----
