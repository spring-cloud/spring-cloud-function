=== Microsoft Azure

The https://azure.microsoft.com[Azure] adapter bootstraps a Spring Cloud Function context and channels function calls from the Azure framework into the user functions, using Spring Boot configuration where necessary. 
Azure Functions has quite a unique and invasive programming model, involving annotations in user code that are specific to the Azure platform. 
However, it is important to understand that because of the style of integration provided by Spring Cloud Function, this annotation-based programming model is simply a type-safe way to configure your simple java function (function that has no awareness of Azure) to be recognized as Azure function. 

All you need to annotate the your class with `@Component` or `@Service` annotations, auto-wire the required Spring Cloud Function beans, define and configure your Azure function handler. This Azure handler method provides input and output types as annotated method parameters (enabling Azure to inspect the class and create JSON bindings).

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyAzureFunction {

	@Autowired
	private Function<String, String> uppercase;

	@FunctionName("ditest")
	public String execute(
			@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = { HttpMethod.GET,
					HttpMethod.POST }, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
			ExecutionContext context) {

		return this.uppercase.apply(request.getBody().get());
	}
}
----

Aside form providing configuration via Azure annotation, inside the body of this handler method we make use of the `uppercase` bean to compute the result. 

The actual user function you're delagating to looks like this

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
		return payload -> payload.toUpperCase();
}
----

In order to enable the Azure Function integration add the azure adapter dependency to your `pom.xml`
file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-function-adapter-azure</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Note: version `4.0.0+` is requried. Having the adapter on the classpath activates the Azure Java Worker integration.

==== Accessing Azure ExecutionContext

Some time there is a need to access the target execution context provided by the Azure runtime in the form of `com.microsoft.azure.functions.ExecutionContext`.
For example one of such needs is logging, so it can appear in the Azure console.

For that purpose the `AzureFunctionUtil.enhanceInputIfNecessary` allow you to add an instance of the `ExecutionContext` as a Message header so you can retrieve it via `executionContext` key.

[source,java]
----
@FunctionName("ditest")
public String execute(
		@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = { HttpMethod.GET,
				HttpMethod.POST }, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
		ExecutionContext context) {

    Message message = AzureFunctionUtil.enhanceInputIfNecessary(request.getBody().get(), context);

	return this.uppercase.apply(message);
}
----

now you can retrieve it via the via `executionContext` key.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Function<Message<String>, String> uppercase(JsonMapper mapper) {
	return message -> {
		String value = message.getPayload();
		ExecutionContext context = (ExecutionContext) message.getHeaders().get("executionContext");
		. . .
	}
}
----

==== Notes on JAR Layout

You don't need the Spring Cloud Function Web at runtime in Azure, so you can exclude this before you create the JAR you deploy to Azure, but it won't be used if you include it, so it doesn't hurt to leave it in. 
A function application on Azure is an archive generated by the `azure-functions-maven-plugin` Maven plugin. 
The function lives in the JAR file generated by this project. 
The sample creates it as an executable jar, using the thin layout, so that Azure can find the handler classes. If you prefer you can just use a regular flat JAR file. 
The dependencies should *not* be included.

==== Build file setup

In order to run Spring Cloud Function applications on Microsoft Azure, you can leverage the `azure-functions-maven-plugin` Maven plugin offered by the cloud platform provider.

You will need to provide Azure-specific configuration for your application, specifying the `resourceGroup`, `appName` and other optional properties, and add the `package` goal execution so that the `function.json` file required by Azure is generated for you. Full plugin documentation can be found in the https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins[plugin repository].

Runtime configurations: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-java?tabs=bash%2Cconsumption#java-versions[Java Versions], https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-java?tabs=bash%2Cconsumption#specify-the-deployment-os[Deployment OS]

Add the `start-class` POM property to point to your main (e.g. SpringApplication) class.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
	<java.version>17</java.version>
	<start-class>YOUR MAIN CLASS</start-class>
	...
</properties>
----

You will also have to ensure that the files to be scanned by the plugin can be found in the Azure functions staging directory (see the https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins[plugin repository] for more details on the staging directory and it's default location).

Add the `host.json` configuration under the `src/main/resources` folder:

[source,json]
----
{
	"version": "2.0",
	"extensionBundle": {
		"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
		"version": "[3.*, 4.0.0)"
	}
}

You can find the entire sample `pom.xml` file for deploying Spring Cloud Function applications to Microsoft Azure with Maven https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/blob/{branch}/spring-cloud-function-samples/function-azure-di-samples/azure-blob-trigger-demo/pom.xml[here].

NOTE: As of yet, only Maven plugin is available. Gradle plugin has not been created by
the cloud platform provider.

==== Build

----
./mvnw -U clean package
----

==== Running locally

To run locally on top of `Azure Functions`, and to deploy to your live Azure environment, you will need `Azure Functions Core Tools` installed along with the Azure CLI (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-java?tabs=bash%2Cazure-cli%2Cbrowser#configure-your-local-environment[here]). 
For some configuration you would need the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator[Azurite emulator] as well.

Then run the sample:

----
./mvnw azure-functions:run
----

==== Running on Azure

Make sure you are logged in your Azure account.

----
az login
----

and deploy

----
./mvnw azure-functions:deploy
----

==== Debug locally

Run the function in debug mode.

----
./mvnw azure-functions:deploy -DenableDebug
----

Alternatively and the `JAVA_OPTS` value to your `local.settings.json` like this:

[source,json]
----
{
	"IsEncrypted": false,
	"Values": {
		...
		"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "java",
		"JAVA_OPTS": "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=127.0.0.1:5005"
	}
}
----


VS Code remote debug configuration:

[source,xml]
----
{
"version": "0.2.0",
"configurations": [
	{
		"type": "java",
		"name": "Attach to Remote Program",
		"request": "attach",
		"hostName": "localhost",
		"port": "5005"
	},  
}

==== (Legacy) FunctionInvoker integration option

The https://azure.microsoft.com[Azure] adapter bootstraps a Spring Cloud Function context and channels function calls from the Azure 
framework into the user functions, using Spring Boot configuration where necessary. Azure Functions has quite a unique and 
invasive programming model, involving annotations in user code that are specific to the Azure platform. 
However, it is important to understand that because of the style of integration provided by Spring Cloud Function, specifically `org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.azure.FunctionInvoker`, this annotation-based programming model is simply a type-safe way to configure 
your simple java function (function that has no awareness of Azure) to be recognized as Azure function. 
All you need to do is create a handler that extends `FunctionInvoker`, define and configure your function handler method and 
make a callback to `handleRequest(..)` method. This handler method provides input and output types as annotated method parameters 
(enabling Azure to inspect the class and create JSON bindings).


```java
public class UppercaseHandler extends FunctionInvoker<Message<String>, String> {

	@FunctionName("uppercase")
	public String execute(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET,
			HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
		ExecutionContext context) {
		Message<String> message = MessageBuilder.withPayload(request.getBody().get()).copyHeaders(request.getHeaders()).build();
		return handleRequest(message, context);
	}
}
```

Note that aside form providing configuration via Azure annotation we create an instance of `Message` inside the body of this handler method and make a callback to `handleRequest(..)` method returning its result. 

The actual user function you're delagating to looks like this

```java
@Bean
public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
		return payload -> payload.toUpperCase();
}

OR

@Bean
public Function<Message<String>, String> uppercase() {
		return message -> message.getPayload().toUpperCase();
}

```

Note that when creating a Message you can copy HTTP headers effectively making them available to you if necessary. 

The `org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.azure.FunctionInvoker` class has two useful 
methods (`handleRequest` and `handleOutput`) to which you can delegate the actual function call, so mostly the function will only ever have one line.

The function name (definition) will be retrieved from Azure's `ExecutionContext.getFunctionName()` method, effectively supporting multiple function in the application context.

==== Accessing Azure ExecutionContext

Some time there is a need to access the target execution context provided by the Azure runtime in the form of `com.microsoft.azure.functions.ExecutionContext`.
For example one of such needs is logging, so it can appear in the Azure console.

For that purpose the FunctionInvoker will add an instance of the `ExecutionContext` as a Message header so you can retrieve it via `executionContext` key.

```
@Bean
public Function<Message<String>, String> uppercase(JsonMapper mapper) {
	return message -> {
		String value = message.getPayload();
		ExecutionContext context = (ExecutionContext) message.getHeaders().get("executionContext");
		. . .
	}
}
```

==== Notes on JAR Layout

You don't need the Spring Cloud Function Web at runtime in Azure, so you can exclude this
before you create the JAR you deploy to Azure, but it won't be used if you include it, so
it doesn't hurt to leave it in. A function application on Azure is an archive generated by
 the Maven plugin. The function lives in the JAR file generated by this project.
 The sample creates it as an executable jar, using the thin layout, so that Azure can find
 the handler classes. If you prefer you can just use a regular flat JAR file.
 The dependencies should *not* be included.

==== Build file setup

In order to run Spring Cloud Function applications on Microsoft Azure, you can leverage the Maven
plugin offered by the cloud platform provider.

In order to use the adapter plugin for Maven, add the plugin dependency to your `pom.xml`
file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-function-adapter-azure</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Then, configure the plugin. You will need to provide Azure-specific configuration for your
application, specifying the `resourceGroup`, `appName` and other optional properties, and
 add the `package` goal execution so that the `function.json` file required by Azure is
  generated for you. Full plugin documentation can be found in the https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins[plugin repository].

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
	<artifactId>azure-functions-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<configuration>
		<resourceGroup>${functionResourceGroup}</resourceGroup>
		<appName>${functionAppName}</appName>
	</configuration>
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<id>package-functions</id>
			<goals>
				<goal>package</goal>
			</goals>
		</execution>
	</executions>
</plugin>
----

You will also have to ensure that the files to be scanned by the plugin can be found in the
Azure functions staging directory (see the https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins[plugin repository]
 for more details on the staging directory and it's default location).

You can find the entire sample `pom.xml` file for deploying Spring Cloud Function
applications to Microsoft Azure with Maven https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/blob/{branch}/spring-cloud-function-samples/function-sample-azure/pom.xml[here].

NOTE: As of yet, only Maven plugin is available. Gradle plugin has not been created by
the cloud platform provider.

==== Build

----
./mvnw -U clean package
----

==== Running the sample

You can run the sample locally, just like the other Spring Cloud Function samples:

---
./mvnw spring-boot:run
---

and `curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" localhost:8080/api/uppercase -d '{"value": "hello foobar"}'`.

You will need the `az` CLI app (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-java-maven for more detail). To deploy the function on Azure runtime:

----
$ az login
$ mvn azure-functions:deploy
----

On another terminal try this: `curl https://<azure-function-url-from-the-log>/api/uppercase -d '{"value": "hello foobar!"}'`. Please ensure that you use the right URL for the function above. Alternatively you can test the function in the Azure Dashboard UI (click on the function name, go to the right hand side and click "Test" and to the bottom right, "Run").

The input type for the function in the Azure sample is a Foo with a single property called "value". So you need this to test it with something like below:

----
{
  "value": "foobar"
}
----

NOTE: The Azure sample app is written in the "non-functional" style (using `@Bean`). The functional style (with just `Function` or `ApplicationContextInitializer`) is much faster on startup in Azure than the traditional `@Bean` style, so if you don't need `@Beans` (or `@EnableAutoConfiguration`) it's a good choice. Warm starts are not affected.
